## Overview

As college students move out on their own, it may be challenging for some to find ways to cook fast and convenient meals, which saves money over ordering expensive restaurant food and unhealthy fast food. Fortunately, there is a kitchen appliance quickly gaining popularity which can be a game-changer for the novice chef: the air fryer

An air fryer offers an extremely easy way to make food quickly while reducing mess and calories. It is a great way to make easy student-freindly staples like fries, chicken nuggets, or other crispy favorites while also reducing risk of fires by forgetful students preoccupied with studying and homework. It offers the speed and convenience of being able to drop in some food, turn on a timer, and being able to safely walk away that a microwave offers, while not sacrificing texture and flavor, and at a similar price point.

In addition to being able to make crispy frozen food items, air fryers can be used to easily prepare a number of simple recipes made from quality ingredients that would normally require a full oven or stove top and only take up a small amount of space in a dorm room or small apartment kitchen, making them ideal for students. Curated on this site are some simple recipes that a novice cook can prepare in a few minutes from a small handful of ingredients at a reasonable price, along with resources for where to find these ingredients. 

## Recipes

We will be finding recipes to encompass a variety of dietary restrictions (i.e., Keto, Vegan, etc), as well as options for options to swap ingredients to modify recipes to fit such requirements

## Stores

We will also be including a list of stores along with ingredients they offer, and the pricing for the ingredients

### User Guide

## Pages

* [Landing page](#landing-page)
* [User inventory page](#user-inventory-page)
* [User recipes page](#user-recipes-page)
* [All recipes page](#all-recipes-page)
* [Nutritions page](#nutritions-page)


### Landing page
The landing page provides an aesthetic overview of the site. We will eventually add more descriptions of the site's features to the landing page which explains the functions of the pages and the benefits of creating an account

[Go to Landing page.](http://159.89.54.201/)

### User inventory page
The user inventory page lists all of the ingredients that a user owns. It lists each ingredient as a card, and has a link which directs the user to the ingredient's nutrition page. Currently, it has no way of adding new ingredients to the inventory, this will be implemented once we get the vendor page going.

[Go to Inventory page.](http://159.89.54.201/#/inventory) (must be logged in, currently unable to add but shows some default items)

### User recipes page
The User recipe page lists the user's created recipes. The recipe card needs improvement, and a feature is being considered to bring the user to a new site which displays the recipe instead of just on the card. We plan to differentiate between All Recipes and User Recipes in the future to allow a user to edit or remove their additions.

### Add recipes page
The add recipe page allows a user to add their own recipe. The public feature still needs to be implemented correctly, and server defined ingredients are to be added in the future, which will allow the computation of the recipe as a whole.

### Nutritions page
Previously, the nutritions fact was displayed on a separate page. However, we found that it would make more sense if the nutrition facts for a given item would display without moving pages, allowing the user to easily view each ingredient's nutritional info without losing their place on the list that they are viewing.

### Developer Guide
In order to run this website on your own server, follow the instructions below.

First, [install meteor.](https://www.meteor.com/install)

Next, go to the source code of Air Fry Till I Die via the [github page](https://github.com/Air-Fry-Till-I-Die/Air-Fry-Till-I-Die). Once your at the projects homepage, click the green Code button, and download ZIP. Once downloaded, extract it to the directory of your choice.

Then, using a terminal or something similar, move to the directory to which you've extracted the files. Use the following command to install the libraries:
```
$ meteor npm install
```

And lastly, run the website with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

If everything goes well, the website will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
